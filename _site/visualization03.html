                        <h1>Feminism in the digital Era</h1>

                        <p>
                            Examples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns like Everyday Sexism, Free The Nipple, HeForShe, MeToo and YesAllWomen shows how the social networks have become a new effective way to spread and to encourage feminism protests. As can be seen in the visualization based on the data gained from Google Trend, the MeToo movement that focuses on sexual harassment and sexual assault is the most significant of them all and and continues to spread more and more everyday.
