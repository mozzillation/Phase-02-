### Description
With this protocol we wanted to discover if there is a tendency in the way the online sources talk about the gender-based hate. Using on Google Search the queries “Hate against women” and “Hate against men” we checked if the results were actually talking about the hate for which they had been searched for. While looking at the hate orientation we clustered the typology of the sources, finding that even 58% most of the results were news, 16% were organizations websites, 10% were blogs, 9% were institutions websites and 7% were references like dictionaries or wikipedia definitions about the topic. While in the query “Hate against women” the main sources were news, organizations and institutions, in the query “Hate against man” the main source was only the news typology. 

Instead, for what concerns the orientation, the results were highly pointing in one direction: even 68% of all the sources were talking about hate against women, proving that the balance of hate is hanging on the female side. Furthermore, it was interesting to notice that most of the sources related to the query “Hate against women” were really oriented towards women, while it was different for the query “Hate against man”, whose orientation was split between men and women. 


### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{'/assets/images/protocols/protocol-02.svg' | relative_url }})

We searched for both queries on google.com in incognito mode to be sure that the results were generated using anonymous browsing and with no nationality to influence the outcome. We extracted the first 100 results for each query and excluded the e-commerce ones, keeping only 50 results for the visualization. Then we manually clustered the typology of the sources and we identified the gender-based hate orientation.
