### Description
In order to have a better understanding on how feminism has evolved over time we used Wikipedia as a reliable source to identify the different events of the four waves of feminism. The aim of the protocol was to underline how throughout the years the fight for feminism evolved, changing his key issues in relation to the historical events. Starting from this idea, the different events are clustered in eight categories: education, online activism, organization, protest, publishing, rights, society and work.

Every wave is represented by a treemap that change his shape through the years, underlining the relevance of a single category over time. For example it’s evident how the categories regarding rights and education were more important during the first wave (1900s to 1950s), that was focused on legal issues, like gaining the right to vote, or the right to own a property. The second-wave (1960s to 1980s) had an increase in the society category because it faced problems like reducing inequalities in sex, family and in the workplace. Otherwise in the third wave (1990s to 2011) it’s possible to see a lot of publications that encouraged the embrace of individualism and diversity, while the fourth wave, that began around 2012 and continues nowadays, is associated with the use of social media as the new online activism category highlights.

Under each treemap is possible to see the specific events related to that wave, in order to make easier to understand the evolution and to have a more complete information about the events. The online activities visualization instead,cfocuses on the use of online campaigns like Everyday Sexism, Free The Nipple, HeForShe, MeToo and YesAllWomen. The visualization shows how the social networks have become a new effective way to spread and to encourage feminist protests worldwide. 

### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{'/assets/images/protocols/protocol-03.svg' | relative_url }})

As a starting point we extracted the timelines from the english pages of the four waves on Wikipedia (except for the second-wave who has a specific wikipedia page about the timeline). After merging the datasets and we manually clustered the events in categories calculating the relative percentages. Instead, for the specific timeline of the fourth wave we searched the main online campaigns on Google Trend and Google News, in order to connect the research spikes to their causative events.
