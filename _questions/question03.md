### Description
In order to have a better understanding on how feminism has evolved over time we used Wikipedia as a reliable source to identify the different events of the four waves of feminism. The aim of the protocol was to underline how throughout the years the fight for equality evolved, changing its key issues in relation to the historical events. Starting from this idea, the different events are clustered in eight categories: education, online activism, organization, protest, publishing, rights, society and work.

Every wave is represented by a treemap that changes its shape through the years, underlining the relevance of a single category over time. For example it’s evident how the categories regarding rights and education were more important during the first wave (1900s to 1950s), that was focused on legal issues, like gaining the right to vote, or the right to own property. The second-wave (1960s to 1980s) had an increase in the society category because it faced problems like reducing inequalities in sex, family and in the workplace. Furthermore in the third wave (1990s to 2011) it’s possible to see a lot of publications that encouraged the embrace of individualism and diversity, while the fourth wave, that began around 2012 and continues nowadays, is associated with the use of social media as the new online activism category highlights.

Under each treemap is possible to see the specific events related to that wave, in order to make it easier to understand the evolution and to have a more complete information about the events. The online activism category of the fourth-wave include campaigns like Everyday Sexism, Free The Nipple, HeForShe, MeToo and YesAllWomen that focus on different topics and show how social networks have become a new effective way to spread and to encourage feminism protests. 

### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{'/assets/images/protocols/protocol-03.svg' | relative_url }})

The timelines of the events are extracted from the english pages of the four waves on Wikipedia (except for the second-wave who has a specific wikipedia page about the timeline). After merging the datasets we manually clustered the categories of the events and made a conditioned analysis of their percentages.
