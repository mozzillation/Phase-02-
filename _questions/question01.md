### Description
Going back to the [first phase of research](https://densitydesign.github.io/teaching-dd14/es01/group01/), it became necessary to deepen the semantic spheres related to sexism in order to explore new areas of daily misogyny: starting from Wikipedia's taxonomies, it was possible to insert each page obtained through the tool Seealsology within a macro-category, returning 5 of most relevance.

The distance value represents the degrees of separation from the initial seed, ie the "Sexism" Wikipedia page.

### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{'/assets/images/protocols/protocol-01.svg' | relative_url }})

During the clustering phase of each Wikipedia page, it emerged that many of them had more than one category: it was decided to consider, among them, the most frequents within the entire dataset through, in order to return categories as wide as possible. Moreover, the pages not related to misogyny were discarded.
