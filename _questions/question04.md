### Description

To identify the online newspapers more involved in the fourth-wave feminism and how the attention towards feminism evolved during the years, we searched on Google News the most relevant articles concerning feminism published from 2012 to 2018. As can be seen, the biggest amount of articles was published in 2013, year in which the controversies around feminism started to spread around media and social networks, followed by 2018, the year that witness the rising of MeToo.

Each year, according to the online news, feminism is visually represented by different categories of images: the wider category is the one represented by stakeholder and celebrities (351 images), followed by protests (114 images), symbology (98 images), stock images (94 images) and movie and videos (51 images).

While for the first visualization we used only the online sources with more than 10 articles obtaining 15 newspapers, for the visualization of the images we used all the results gathered from the research on Google News: each link was scraped for its preview image, leading to a corpus of 708 images that were distributed to the different categories over the years.
